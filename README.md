In a pure layered application UI-, domain-, and data-entities are completely separated classes. While being beneficial, the process of mapping between these enitities can easily become rather mind numbing work.

This is where Columbus enters. Columbus uses annotations to map fields between classes.

*Version 0.1 is under development.*
